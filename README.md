**WHAT? >>** This is a summary of the end-to-end history of Lebanon, from ancient times till the Beirut Port explosion in 2020.

**WHY? >>** There isn't a single, exhaustive, digestible and concise summary of Lebanon's history end-to-end... so here it is!

**WHO? >>** This is meant for people with a spotty knowledge of Lebanon's history who are not willing to embark in lengthy books/courses.

**HOW? >>** Simply navigate each of the 7 timelines, while referring to the associated maps and plots for more context (when needed).

## Disclaimers
** All timelines are about events happening WITHIN PRESENT-DAY LEBANESE TERRITORY, with some exceptions for external events that are important to understand Lebanon's internal developments (e.g., PLO's attack in the Munich olympics triggered retaliations inside Lebanese territory).

** There are 3 maps showing all locations mentioned in the 7 timelines, including cities, seas, and notable places (e.g., refugee camps). While navigating the timelines, you will see the following superscripts next to those locations: ¹ (referring to the world map), ² (referring to the Lebanon map), or ³ (referring to the Beirut map).

** There is 1 visual/plot of all political parties (not only Lebanese parties) which were mentioned in the 7 timelines, including coalitions of parties.

** When an event that shows up on a given timeline is disputed, we add the '*' sign next to it.

** For a full experience, users must be connected to the internet while navigating the timelines, as we often add interactive images (from the web) for certain events.
