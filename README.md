**WHAT? >>** This is a summary of the end-to-end history of Lebanon, from ancient times till the Beirut Port explosion in 2020.

**WHY? >>** There isn't a single, exhaustive, digestible and concise summary of Lebanon's history end-to-end... so here it is!

**WHO? >>** This is meant for people with a spotty knowledge of Lebanon's history who are not willing to embark in lengthy books/courses.

**HOW? >>** Simply navigate each of the 7 timelines, while referring to the associated maps and plots for more context (when needed).

## Disclaimers
**All timelines are about events happening WITHIN PRESENT-DAY LEBANESE TERRITORY, with some exceptions for external events that are important to understand internal developments (e.g., PLO's attack in the Munich olympics triggered retaliations inside Lebanese territory).**

**There are 3 maps showing all locations mentioned in the 7 timelines, including notable places (e.g., refugee camps):**
- While navigating the timelines, you will see superscripts next to locations: ¹ (cf. World map), ² (cf. Lebanon's map), or ³ (cf. Beirut's map)
- In the maps, some locations will be in capital letters (=region), italic (=sea), regular characters (=city), or between brackets (=place)

**There is 1 plot of all political parties (not only Lebanese) which were mentioned in the 7 timelines, including coalitions of parties.**

**The online reference of every event that appears on the timeline, as well as the full description of abbreviations, acronyms and symbols that are used can be seen right under the timeline plots (in each of the 7 timelines).**

**When an event that shows up on a given timeline is disputed, we add the '*' sign next to it.**

**Users must be connected to the internet while navigating timelines, as interactive images from the web are often added for more context.**
