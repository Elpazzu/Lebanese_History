**WHAT? >>** This is a summary of the end-to-end history of Lebanon, from ancient times till August 4th 2020.

**WHY? >>** There isn't a single, exhaustive and concise summary of Lebanon's history end-to-end... so here it is!

**WHO? >>** It is for tech-oriented people with a spotty knowledge of Lebanon's history, aiming to further enrich it.

**HOW? >>** By navigating the timelines within a Jupyter notebook, in a guided manner, while referring to the associated maps and plots for more context.

## Disclaimers
-) All timelines are about events happening WITHIN PRESENT-DAY LEBANESE TERRITORY, with some exceptions for external events that are important to understand internal developments (e.g., PLO's attack in the Munich olympics triggered retaliations inside Lebanese territory).

-) The timelines are INTERACTIVE and designed as "stories" of sequential historical events. The 7 timelines are available in 1 Jupyter notebook, in sequence from the oldest to the most recent. You can launch the notebook in Binder and start navigating the timelines here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Elpazzu/Lebanese_History/main?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2FLebanon_Timeline.ipynb)  

-) There are 3 maps showing all locations mentioned in the 7 timelines, including notable places (e.g., refugee camps):
- While navigating the timelines, you will see superscripts next to locations: ¹ for [World Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elpazzu/Lebanese_History/data/World_Map.png), ² for [Lebanon map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elpazzu/Lebanese_History/data/Lebanon_Map.png) or ³ for [Beirut map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Elpazzu/Lebanese_History/data/Beirut_Map.png)
- In the maps, locations can be in capital letters (=region/area), in italic (=sea), in regular font (=city), between brackets (=place), or with an "(H)" at the end (=historical location that no longer exists)

-) There is 1 [INTERACTIVE plot of all political entities](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Elpazzu/Lebanese_History/blob/data/Lebanese_Politics_Plot.html), including parties, militias and coalitions that got mentioned:
- You can click on legend items to only display specific entities for better visibility
- You can hover over horizontal bars to see more info on the political partirs & militias (e.g., flag, religion...)
- When a political party is directly associated with a militia, there are red lines on the plot linking the two

-) The online reference of every event that appears on the timeline, as well as the full description of abbreviations, acronyms and symbols that are used can be seen right under the timeline plots (in each of the 7 timelines).

-) Users MUST BE CONNECTED TO INTERNET to be able to navigate the timelines
